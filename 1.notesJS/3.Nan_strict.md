## NaN

- console.log(5 + 4 / 3);   
`returns 3`

- console.log(undefined / 5);    
`returns NaN;`

or  also `returns NaN`  

     function test1 (a) {
        console.log(a/5);
     }
     test1();
     
When u debug your code and call a function, and
somewhere inside the function something starts
throwing a NaN, chances are that was something that
was supposed to be passed into that function.

## Strict Equality
````
    var x=4, y='4';

    if (x == y) {
        console.log(x,y);
    }
    returns 4,"4" and true
````
Eventhough string can't be possibly be equal to a 
number - what's going on is type coercion. The language
converts something from one type to another on the
fly.    
JavaScript prior to evaluate equality converts,
one type to be the same as the other variable first,
and only then compares the variables.

If you don't like that then there is: **Strict
Equality.**

````
    var x=4, y='4';

    if (x === y) {
        console.log(x,y);
    }
    returns 4,"4" and false
````
Now JavaScript won't make sure that they are of
the same type before it makes comparison. If they
are not of the same type, then the interpreter wont
go any further.

## What JS considers to be Boolean true and Boolean false

###false:

- false
- null
- undefined
- ""
- 0
- NaN


    if (false || null || undefined || "" || 0 || NaN) {
      console.log("this line will never execute");
    } else {
      console.log("All false");
      
    }   // returns All false
 
 

### true:

- true
- 1
- -1
- "false"


    if (true && "hello" && 1 && -1 && "false") {
        console.log("All true");
        
    } //returns All true


### If you're not sure whether is true or false
Use the Boolean object.

Ex:

    Boolean(null);
    > returns false
    
    Boolean("");
    > returns false
    
    Boolean("hello world");
    > returns true
    
### Curly brace on same line or next line. Is it just style?

    function a() 
    {
       return   // it ends right here!
       {
           name: "Stefano"
       }
    }
    
    function b() {
        return {
            name: "Stefano"
        }
    }
    
 console.log(a());    
` //returns undefined `   
It looks at return and since it's returning 
nothing returns undefined.    
  
 console.log(b());       
` //returns Object {name: "Stefano"}`
