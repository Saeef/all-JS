# Scope

[![N|global](images/globalScope.png)](https://github.com/stefan22/eloqJS/blob/master/eloqJSnotes/5.%20Global_n_Local_Scope.md)

Global and Local Scope (or function scope):

  - Global/local Scope is defined by where the variable first originated
  - Global/local Scope has to do with the execution context of some code/function
  - Generally if var has been set inside of a function, then likely to be local to the function
  
In order to better understand Scope, it's important to know that everytime a Function/Code block gets Executed,
it automatically creates its own (a brand new) execution context, a $this variable and an OUTER context environment; in case code/function execution originated outside of current scope.

### Example js file  - Question is what is the value of message when you call function a
I just explained it here above. But basically, exec a, it also invokes b; which then needs to pick
between content from var message inside of a, or var message sitting outside of a content.


```
//var message is on a global scope
var message = 'this is global scope';
//a is global too and message is local to a
var a = function() {
    var message = 'inside of a';
    return b();
}
//b is on a local scope
var b = function() {
 return 'scope of message is: ' + message;
}

//calling a function
a();

```
#### Starts by Calling/exec Function A

    - exec a calls function b
    - b only passes message in a
    - message did not first originated inside of function a
    - there was a var message before that.
    - exec of function creates a new context env that allows function b
      to go higher/outside of a if needs to 
    - finds var message and assigns the val of that var to message.

####  But lets say function b is inside of function a
    - that changes things then => scope of function b is universe of function a and just like
      Miguel said the other day, carries the advantage of protecting this content. Sort of encapsulating it 
      within its outer function a. Cannot be called from outside of a anymore.
      Bottom line -> for purposes of exercise now value of message is the same for function a & b.
