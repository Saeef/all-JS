### :curly_loop: `for-in loop` use to traverse the properties of an object

````
array:
 
var names2 = ['jacko','sandra', 'michael'];
````
````
object:
 
 var myObj = {

    name: 'jacko',
    level: 5,
    course: 'javascript'

};
````
Ex:        
:rocket: // good for objects cause objects don't have indices like an array does,
            instead, they have properties.   :rocket:


// grab every property in myObj  :round_pushpin:
   
   for (var prop in myObj) {
    
     console.log(prop + ": " + myObj[prop]);
    
   }
   
   var zObj = {      
       
          name: 'Eric',        
          last: 'Cartman',      
          city: 'SouthPark'      
   };     
   
   //to get object prop/values :round_pushpin:
   
   for (var prop in zObj) {         
          console.log(prop + ": " + zObj[prop]);     
   }
   
   returns: :part_alternation_mark:   
   
   > name: Eric   
   > last: Cartman   
   > city: SouthPark  
   
   
   
#### dont use it on arrays (for-in loops)  :x:

````
    var names = ['eric', 'kyle', 'butters'];
  
    names.greeting = "hi ho!";
  
    for (var name in names) {
       console.log("hello " + names[name]);
    }
    
    //returns:
    
    hello eric
    hello kyle
    hello butters
```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  hello hi ho!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// :warning: not part of data in array
    

The reason that is (**'hello hi ho!'**) because the **greeting**
became a **property** of the **array**, no different than a
number zero, or number two, or number one, and so on.
This for loop loops over the property names of the 
object, and since arrays are just objects, this for loops
will loop over properties, even over properties that
have nothing to do with data of array.
