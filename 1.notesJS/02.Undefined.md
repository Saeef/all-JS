## Undefined   :paw_prints:

var x;   
console.log(x);   
`returns undefined`

```sh
    if (x == undefined) {   
       console.log('x is undefined');   
    }
    // x is undefined   
```

var x = 5;   
`returns 5`

```sh
    if (x == undefined) {
        console.log('x is undefined');
    }
    else {
        console.log('x is defined');
    }
    // x is defined
```

Now try this:   :full_moon_with_face:

```sh
    console.log(r)
    // Uncaught ReferenceError: r is not defined
```

#### undefined is NOT the SAME as not defined  :first_quarter_moon_with_face:

console.log(r) should it have returned `undefined`        
but instead returns `not defined`

#### Reason is:  :waning_gibbous_moon:
`undefined` in JavaScript has a special meaning:    :crescent_moon:
- it has been **declared** but
- **value** has **not** been yet **set**

Here for example:    

```sh
    var r;    
    console.log(r);   
```

In this case, the **variable** has been **declared** and
a **memory space** has been **allocated** for it, **but** **no**
**value** has been **placed** **in** that **memory space**.
