## handling Events

:zap: events handlers are basically functions that you bind using
specific methods to certain events that happen in the browser.
- these events could be trigger by something that happened
  in the browser, like page loading
- user interaction, like user click something


### :cactus: <kbd>option I</kbd> placing event straight on html
````
    <button onblur="sayHello();">sayWhat</button>
````
  
- adds non html content to your page 

- since in the `onblur()`, `onclick()` event, we are
  not doing anything to change the context, simply
  executing the function at that location, thus it remains
  the same.
  
#### :cactus: `this` variable on separate `<script>`  file would point to ` window object`
  (cause is being define in the global context)  
  
  
### :cactus: <kbd>option II</kbd> binding the function to the click event

- its called unobstrusive `event` binding cause
  the `html` doesn't need to know anything about
  your javaScript
  
Ex

````
    document.querySelector('button')
    .addEventListener('click', sayHello);

````
> select an **element**, listen for the **click** event      
>  and what that happened call **sayHello()**.

#### :postbox: `this` points to?   
the **this** variable, inside of function **now points**
to the **button element**;  which makes sense cause that
is the **event that click the function**.

#### :postbox: <kbd>option II.5</kbd> or part of 2
**Another similar way** to assign that click handler,
instead **using** the **onclick** property    

Ex. 
we're **selecting** the **button element**, and **setting** its **onclick**
**property** to be the **value** of the **function**, sayHello.
(**without parentheses**) :triangular_flag_on_post:
````
    document.querySelector('button')
            .onclick = sayHello;
             
````
#### :loudspeaker:    **Note:**    
You can always use whatever **onclick**, **onblur**, **on whatever**
as **a property** of the **element** you are **selecting**.

#### :cactus: `this` points to?
Here the `this` variable, it's pointing/ being **executed inside** 
of the **button object** so, the same: **button element**.

### :loudspeaker: inline onclick event vs onclick events on `<script>` file

````     
    document.querySelector('button')
        .addEventListener('click', sayHello);
               
````
this way above provides a bit more flexibility than
inline events.


:cactus: Ex.:   
`As I'm typing`, I want the name of the **button**/ label value
to **change**.

> this is very easy to do if the `this` variable
  inside of the event handler **already points directly
  to the target element**      
  
  **Clicking** on **button** now **will result** on **ALSO** the
  value of the **button changing to ` Said it dont forget it!!`**  :tada:
  
> and so `this below` :arrow_down: is better than once again having to select the button and change its label.  :japanese_goblin:
  
````
    //event handling
    function sayHello (event) {
        this.textContent = "Said it dont forget it!!";
        var name = document.
                   getElementById('name').value;
        var message = "hello " + name;
        
        document
        .getElementById('content')
        .textContent = message;
    
    }

````
### :loudspeaker: DOMContentLoaded `event`
- part of the life cycle event of the page
- lets you assign events to elements once they load,
  but before anything else loads.
  - before any images
  - before any css etc
  
:cactus: Since we're going to be **listening for the
event**, we **NO LONGER** need to provide the `<script>`
at the bottom of the page. :x:

Ex.:

````
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', 
        function(event) {
        //every event handler function gets the event argument above  
        
           //add function sayHello in it
           function sayHello (event) {
               this.textContent = "Said it dont forget it!!";
               var name = document.
                   getElementById('name').value;
               var message = "hello " + name;
            
               document
               .getElementById('content')
               .textContent = message;
        
           }//sayHello    
             
        }//DOMContentLoaded
     );
   

````
:tropical_drink: So now we have the **entire function sitting inside**
of the **addEventListener**.
