## HTTP recap
- `Ajax` a client-server communication technique  
- `HTTP` its language or **protocol**.
- **H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol :bulb:
- Based on **request**/**response** **stateless** protocol

<hr>


:electric_plug: HTTP is **stateless**, meaning that **when a server responds** to
a **request** from a **browser**, that respond **does not**
**depend on any previous requests** that the browser made.

:electric_plug: **As far as the actual language** in which the client,
the browser and server communicate, **the server has
no idea whether or not the client has requested
anything from it before**.

<hr>


### :airplane: client/ server communication

- client opens connection to server
- client sends HTTP request for a resource
- server sends HTTP response to the client
    - usually with resource or
    - sometimes an error occur or
    - sometimes resource not found
- client closes connection to the server

### :paperclip: Identifying resources on the web

- **URN**: **uniform resource name** :triangular_flag_on_post:
    - this is a way to uniquely identify a
      name or resource
    - urn do not tell us how to get a resource
  
- **URI**: **uniform resource identifier** :triangular_flag_on_post:
    - uniquely identifies resource or location
      of resource. (but does not tell you how to
      get a resource cause context usually missing)    
      **ex.:**    
      **/web_site/index.html**     
      I would not be able to get resource having
      been provided this by itself. Need the root part too!
- **URL**: **uniform resource locator** :triangular_flag_on_post:
    - a form of URI that provides info on how to get
      resource.    
      **ex.:**   
      <kbd>-</kbd> `http://www.myfreegaragesalead.com/contact.htm`

### :circus_tent: HTTP Request Structure (GET)

````
GET /index.html?firstName=Stefano  HTTP/1.1
````

> command a browser issues to get at a particular
resource on a website

:rocket: `This command` is a **URI** and not a URL. Also:                 
This command is **only issued once** the **browser** actually **connects to
the server.**             

`So by this point`, we are **already connected** and established a connection to the site.
`Therefore`, what we are **asking for is a URI** within the context of that website. :rocket:   
> #### :loudspeaker: **and the way we ask for it is using the HTTP protocol**

:electric_plug: **Browser**, first needs to **make a connection**, and **once** a
connection is **established starts the HTTP protocol**.

![GET Request](images/getrequest.png?raw=true "mobile" target="_blank")
     
### :crossed_flags: HTTP methods

#### GET :key:
- retrieves the resource
- data is passed to server as part of URI
    - ex.: query string

#### POST :key:
- sends data to server in order to be processed
- data is sent in the message body

> more methods avail like PUT and DELETE etc.


### typical POST request:phone:

- **no query string** - data we're passing comes
  as **part of the body of the message**
- **First line** is the **POST request** itself  
- **Accept-Charset** is **telling** the **server** that our
  **browser knows how to process utf-8** character set.
- the **message body** is where **data is being passed**


![POST Request](images/postrequest.png?raw=true "mobile" target="_blank")

 ### HTTP response structure :package:
     
- It starts with just a response status line.
- the response status line has 3 components:
    - HTTP version (version of HTTP is communicating)
    - Response Status code
    - English phrase describing status code
    - all 3 parts are separated by a single space
     
http response structure    
![HTTP response structure](images/httpresponse.png?raw=true "mobile" target="_blank")
    

typical http response:     
![HTTP response structure](images/typicalhttpresponse.png?raw=true "mobile" target="_blank")   
     
- **status code** 200 ok  
- it'll tell you the **content-type** (text/html)
- **date** of this document
- the **body** of the message:**html** in this case   
     
### Some Response Status Codes
     
- 200 OK :postbox:
    - Ok, here is the content you requested
- 404 Not Found  :mailbox_with_no_mail:
    - Server can't find the resource requested
- 403 Forbidden  :gun:
    - Unauthenticated client tried to access a
      secure resource
- 500 Internal Server Error  :space_invader:
    - Some unhandled error was raised on the server
