## Undefined

var x;   
console.log(x);   
`returns undefined`

    if (x == undefined) {   
       console.log('x is undefined');   
    }
    // x is undefined   
  
var x = 5;   
`returns 5`
   
    if (x == undefined) {
        console.log('x is undefined');
    }
    else {
        console.log('x is defined');
    }
    // x is defined


Now try this:   

    console.log(r)
    // Uncaught ReferenceError: r is not defined
    
#### undefined is NOT the SAME as not defined
console.log(r) should it have returned `undefined`
but instead returns `not defined`
#### Reason is:
`undefined` in JavaScript has a special meaning:    
- it has been declared but
- value has not been yet set

Here for example:    

    var r;    
    console.log(r);   
   
In this case, the variable has been declared and
a memory space has been allocated for it, but no
value has been placed in that memory space.
