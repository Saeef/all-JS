## Object Literal and 'this'

:congratulations: Last notes dealt with `'this'` keyword and **how it**
**behaved inside of a function Constructor**, or the
object itself **when** that **function is invoked**.

#### :o2: Here, we'll look at the `Object literal` and how the `'this'` keyword behaves inside of one.
 
 :rocket: An **Object literal** is just **2 curly braces**  :rocket:   all clear then. :)   `var x = {};`
 
 
    // Object literal and 'this'
       var literalCircle = {
          radius: 10,
          getArea: function() {
            console.log(this);
          }
 
       };

:loudspeaker: after executing function method, we get:   

- literalCircle.getArea();   
    `result` Object { radius: 10 }
    
:bulb: :moneybag: So when an object literal gets created, `'this'`, instead
of pointing to the global Object, is actually
**pointing** to the **actual object** that got created.

:loudspeaker: So now we could do something like this:

        //Object literal and 'this'
          var literalCircle = {
               radius: 10,
               getArea: function() {
                 return Math.pow(this.radius,2);
               }
 
          };
          console.log(literalCircle.getArea());

:bulb: :moneybag: `this` refers to **literalCircle** and I
read is perfectly legal to do so.

### :bomb: Sure you must be wanting to know why 'this' is now referring to the Object created.

- when you do **var something = {}**
- that's sort of the same as doing: **new Object()**
- so **new Object()** gets executed in the background
- And **when** you **See** the **"new" keyboard**, the **'this' variable**
  inside of that object refers to that object. And **NOT**
  to the **outside window** or **global object**.
  
:rocket: so it kinda works like a **function Constructor**, but
 the **new object** is implicit, I guess. :rocket:
 
 
:bug:  Bug when inserting another function expression inside
 of another function expression inside of an Object Literal
 
 
        //Object literal and 'this'
           var literalCircle = {
                radius: 10,
                getArea: function() {
                   console.log(this); //res=20
                   
                   var increaseRadius = function() {
                        this.radius = 20; 
                   }
                   increaseRadius(); 
                   console.log(this.radius); //radius still 10
                    
                  return Math.pow(this.radius,2);
                }
  
          };
          console.log(literalCircle.getArea());
          
 

#### :bug: Back to the bug  :collision:    
 The console.log(this) holding the value of this.radius=20,
 now refers to the global object instead.
 
> the value **this.radius** is **10**, and to **check what happened to the 20**,
> when can do: **window.radius**, and we **get 20**.  :thumbsup:   

####:loudspeaker: :bulb: recommended approach:
:rocket:  this is very **ruby like**  :rocket:

       //Object literal and 'this'
       var literalCircle = {
            var self = this;
            radius: 10,
            getArea: function() {
               console.log(this); //res=20
               
               var increaseRadius = function() {
                    self.radius = 20; 
               }
               increaseRadius(); 
                    console.log(this.radius); //radius still 10
                
              return Math.pow(this.radius,2);
            }

       };
       console.log(literalCircle.getArea());
           
           
           
 :rocket: Fixed is: :rocket:
 
 - To set **var self = this** as shown above.
 - Then **we use self, instead of this** inside of function
   expression inside of the other function expression, inside
   of an object literal, **where a 'new Object' instance** 
   **never gets set**, although **clearly implicit** on 'this', **no longer pointing**
   **to** the **window object or global** but instead its object
   creator; which sort of **acts like a function Constructor**
   when it's not, and **apparently** widely known to be **prone to**
   **returning the proper value of this** whenever one function expression inside another one.   
   Fixed avail. Solved in ECMAScript 6 :crown: :trophy: :moneybag:
   
   
#### :barber:  :hotsprings: :warning: <kbd>Trick or Treat</kbd> :pig2: :dog2:
 
 ```
 function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
 }
 
 Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log(this.name + " likes barking !");
 }
 
 
  
  Now use code below to figure out:   
 
  
  var lupo = new Dog('lupo', 'max');
  lupo.bark();
 
 ```
 
 <kbd>Answer:</kbd>  lupo likes barking !
 
 :rocket: The second argument `'max'` is not used in the
  function, but it's perfectly legal to pass it in. :rocket:
