## Object Literal and 'this'

:congratulations: Last notes dealt with `'this'` keyword and **how it**
**behaved inside of a function Constructor**, or the
object itself **when** that **function is invoked**.

#### :o2: Here, we'll look at the `Object literal` and how the `'this'` keyword behaves inside of one.
 
 :rocket: An **Object literal** is just **2 curly braces**  :rocket:   all clear then. :)   `var x = {};`
 
 
    // Object literal and 'this'
       var literalCircle = {
          radius: 10,
          getArea: function() {
            console.log(this);
          }
 
       };

:loudspeaker: after executing function method, we get:   

- literalCircle.getArea();   
    `result` Object { radius: 10 }
    
:bulb: :moneybag: So when an object literal gets created, `'this'`, instead
of pointing to the global Object, is actually
**pointing** to the **actual object** that got created.
