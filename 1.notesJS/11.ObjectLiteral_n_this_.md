## Object Literal and 'this'

:congratulations: Last notes dealt with 'this' keyword and how it
behaved inside of a function Constructor, or the
object itself when that function is invoked.

#### :o2: Here, we'll look at the Object literal and how the 'this' keyword behaves inside of one.
 
 :red_circle: An **Object literal** is just **2 curly braces**
 
 
    // Object literal and 'this'
       var literalCircle = {
          radius: 10,
          getArea: function() {
            console.log(this);
          }
 
       };

try executing function method:    

- literalCircle.getArea();   
    `result` Object { radius: 10 }
    
:bulb: So when an object literal gets created, `'this'`, instead
of pointing to the global Object, is actually
**pointing** to the **actual object** that got created.
