## fake Namespaces
:boom: javaScript doesn't really have built-in support for
namespaces like other languages. It does have objects
and closures which can be used to achieve similar effects.



## <kbd>I</kbd> nested namespacing

Loading a few scripts one after another
````
<!doctype html>
<html lang='en'>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <script src="js/script1.js"></script>
        <script src="js/script2.js"></script>
        <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>some stuff</h1>
    </body>
</html>
````

:triangular_flag_on_post: script1.js

````
 var name = "stefano";
 function sayHella() {
  console.log("hello " + name);
 };
````

:triangular_flag_on_post: script2.js

````
 var name = "Sam";
 function sayHowdy() {
  console.log("howdy " + name);
 };
````

:triangular_flag_on_post: app.js

````
 sayHella();
 sayHowdy();
````

#### :rage3: returns

> hello Sam   
> howdy Sam


### why's happening :question:
<kbd>if i may, please:</kbd>

- first thing the browser loads is **script1.js** and so 
- declares **variable name**, and **function sayHella()** in global scope
- so when function **sayHella() executes**, it will take
- whatever variable is there in **global scope**.
- unfortunately, been re-wrote by the second.script by then.
- let's not get ahead because, after loading **script1.js**, it loads **script2.js**
- so at this point **var name** value **becomes** '**Sam**' (overwritten), and
- **function sayHowdy()** also **gets load**.
- and it's **Now** when the function **execution** calls happened.
- **sayHella()**, returns **hello Sam**,
- **sayHowdy()**, returns **howdy Sam**.  :pray:


### how to solve it :question:

**namespacing** which is a
container for some functionality and declarations

In javaScript, it's done like this:

Ex. script1.js

````
    var greeterOne  = {
    
        greeterOne.name = "stefano";
        greeterOne.sayHella = function() {
            console.log("Hello " + greeterOne.name);
        };
        
    }; //greeterOne
````

ex: script2.js

````
 var greeterTwo = {
    
    var greeterTwo.name = "Sam";
        greeterTwo.sayHowdy = function() {
          console.log("howdy " + greeterTwo.name);
        };
 
 
 };//greeterTwo
 
````
So now everything inside the variables and functions will
have to go through the name space objects.

inside of app.js   :clap:

````
 greeterOne.sayHella();
 greeterTwo.sayHowdy();
 
 returns:
 
 >  hello stefano
 >   howdy Sam
 
````

## <kbd>II</kbd> immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

 :scream_cat:
````
(function() {

    console.log('yup');

}();

````
:scream_cat: :scream_cat: or with an argument:

````
(function(name) {

    console.log('yup' + name);


})('mario';);

     
   //returns
   yup mario
````

> can also do this to the previous namespaces   
Add self-invoke/exec functions and pass the window
object as an argument with greeterOne and two as object
literals. Last, set greeterOne and two as properties   
of the window object.    
Exposed some functions, like greeterTwo.sayHowdy and keep
private var greeting.  :busstop:


 > :shipit: var greeting isn't going to collide with the other greeting.
 Here too, they'll be both running on their own execution context.
 

````
  (function(window) {
    
     var greeterTwo = {};                        
     var greeterTwo.name = "Sam";
     var greeting = "howdy";                
     greeterTwo.sayHowdy = function() {              
       console.log(greeting + " " + greeterTwo.name);    
     };
     
     window.greeterTwo = greeterTwo;
                                               
  }(window);
  
````
