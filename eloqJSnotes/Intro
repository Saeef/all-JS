INTRO

"I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor arouse those who are not anxious to give an explanation themselves. 
If I have presented one corner of the square and they cannot come back to me with the other three, I should not go over the points again."
Confucius

Set “total” to 0.
 Set “count” to 1.
[loop]
 Set “compare” to “count”.
 Subtract 11 from “compare”.
 If “compare” is zero, continue at [end].
 Add “count” to “total”.
 Add 1 to “count”.
 Continue at [loop].
[end]
 Output “total”.

var total = 0;
count = 1;
while(count <=11) {
  total += count;
  count +=1;
}

console.log('the total is: ' + total);
