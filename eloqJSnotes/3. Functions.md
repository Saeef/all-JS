FUNCTIONS
=========
   + A TOOL TO STRUCTURE LARGER PROGRAMS, TO REDUCE REPITION, TO ISOLATE SUBPROGRAMS

   + DEFINING A FUNCTION
        EX
          var square = function(x){
            return x*x;
          }
        // square(2);
        
        SLIGHTLY SHORTER WAY TO SAY "VAR SQUARE =  ... FUNCTION" IS
        EX.
              function square(x){
                return x*x;
              }
       
       -  FUNCTION DECLARATIONS LIKE THIS ONE ABOVE ARE NOT PART OF THE REGULAR TOP-TO-BOTTOM FLOW OF CONTROL - THEY
          MOVE TO THE TOP AND CAN BE USED BY ALL OF THE CODE IN THAT SCOPE.
          
      -   THE PLACE WHERE THE COMPUTER STORES VALUES ETC WHILE EXECUTION IS CALLED STACK - EVERY TIME A FUNCTION IS CALLED
          THE CURRENT CONTEXT IS PUT ON TOP OF THE STACK.
        
        
        
        
   + RETURN KEYWORD WITHOUT AN EXPRESSION AFTER IT, WILL CAUSE FUNCTION TO RETURN UNDEFINED
    
   + VARIABLES CREATED INSIDE A FUNCTION ARE LOCAL TO THE FUNCTION
    
   + VARIABLES DECLARED OUTSIDE OF ANY FUNCTION ARE CALLED GLOBAL
    
   + FUNCTIONS CAN BE CREATED INSIDE OTHER FUNCTIONS
    
   + UNLIKE OTHER LANGUAGES NOT ANY BLOCK OF CODE BTWEEN BRACES PRODUCES A NEW LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
    
   + IN JS FUNCTIONS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT CAN CREATE A NEW SCOPE
    
   + JS IS BROAD-MINDED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS - IF YOU PASS TOO MANY, THE EXTRA ONES ARE IGNORED, 
      IF TOO FEW, THE MISSING PARAMETERS GET ASSIGNED THE VALUE OF UNDEFINED.
      
      
      
CLOSURE
=======

  IT'S GOT TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO REFERENCE A SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF A LOCAL VARIABLE INSIDE OF A FUNCTION.
    
    EX.
    
        function multiplier(factor) {
          return function(number) {
            return factor * number;
          }
        }
        
        var one = multiplier(2);
        console.log(one(5));
    
    
RECURSION
=========
  A FUNCTION THAT CALLS ITSELF IS CALLED RECURSIVE
    
    
#### EXERCISES
 
   EX.
         //write a function that takes 2 arguments and returns their minimum
         // stil too easy
                    function min(x,y) {
                        if (x < y) {
                            return x;
                        } else {
                            return y;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    console.log(min(44,12));

    
    
   EX- BEAN COUNTING LAST ONE - STILL PRETTY EASY
    
      //write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number
      //that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters are in the string
                
            function countBs(string, countwhat) {
                
               var findIt = String(countwhat);
               var letters = 0;
               for (var i=0; i < string.length; i++) {
                   if (string.charAt(i) == findIt) {
                       letters += 1;
                   }

               }
               console.log("There are " + letters + " " + findIt + "(s) on: \n\n" + "'" + string + "'");
                
            }
                
            countBs("Boy what a day Bye", "B");
