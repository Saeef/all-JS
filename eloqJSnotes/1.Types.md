- Browsers JS engine is a single threaded engine
	- Once starts running, it will not stop until is done executing
	- Sequential execution

- On a function expression, the variable name returns the actual
  function, and not the result

  ![s1](f1.png?raw=true "s1")

- function without return keyword won't return shait

- All arguments in functions are optionals even when they don't make sense having
  or not having them - just as far as syntax goes!

- 2 Scopes in Js: Global scope and Local Scope (Function Scope) - There's no block
  scope in JS.  Unlike some other languages where curly braces signify a new Scope;
  here only a Function signify a new Scope.


- Scope Chain - pretty important  HUGE!!
  ==============================
	Executing a Function creates a new Execution Context!
		each exec context has:
			It's own variable Environment
			special 'this' object and
			a reference to its outer Environment.


   ![s2](s2.png?raw=true "s2")


   Function A define in Global Scope, sets x = 2 and
	calls function A - also in global scope.
	Sets x = 5 and calls
	B() that returns console.log(x)

	A: x = 2

	What matters is its Outer Reference value (every function return -above a ref
	to its outer env and x originated on function A)
	So x originated on Function A so x is 2;

	Function B is going to look in Function A and since it didn't orignate
	there is going to use its outer Scope to look further.

- A type is a particular data structure and
  Built-in types can be used to build other data structures

- JS has 7 built-in types:
		
			- 6 primitive and
			- 1 Object type


- Object type 
	-is a collection of name/value pairs and 
	 it can be a nested value like that


	 ![s4](s4.png?raw=true "s4")


- Primitive type represent a SINGLE, immutable value
  meaning once value is set it cannot be changed NOT VALUE PAIRS

  	- right off the top you know then that:
  		
  		its not an object - even the simplest object is a collection
	  	of name-value pair

  	- Once is set, it becomes read-only!
  	- You can create another value based on an existing value, but the 
  	- memory space allocated for the first item does not change - it creates
  	- another memory space.

  
	  
  	* Primitive type: Boolean:

  			Only have True or False => and they are both Reserved Keywords


  	* Primitive type: Undefined

  			- Signifies that no value has ever been set
  			- Undefined is the value that every variable gets when js engine
  			  sets up the value in memory but not assigned a value yet.


  	â€¢ Primitive type: Null

  			- Null signifies the lack of value
  			- undefined not assigned a value, nulls lacks value
  			- both are primitive types


  	* Primitive type: Number

  			- represented under the hood as a 64-bit floating point
  			  (JS does not have an integer type)
  			- integers are a subset of doubles instead of a separate
  			  data type

  	* Primitive type: String

  			- sequence of characters used to represent text
  			  using single or double quotes


  	* Primitive type: Symbol (new to ES6)

  ** example  =>called Type COERCION.

                When the javascript interpreter tries to compare this equality, it converts
                one of the types to be the same type as the other variable, and only then
                compares the values.

    var x= 4, y='4';

    if (x == y) {

      //here there are equal. eventhough typeof x = number
      // and typeof y = string


    }

    Type Coercion = > means that the language converts something from one type
                      to another type automatically - on the fly.


### If you wanna stop JS interpreter from changing out the type on the fly, then go to
    the strict equality. (===)                


###  Things IF Statement would consider False


    if (false || null || undefined || "" || 0 || Nan) {

      console.log('this line wont ever execute');
    
    } else {
      console.log("All false");
    }  

  false are => false, null, undefined, ""(empty string), 0 Nan

  Note =>  You can do this to double check whether the boolean suppose to evaluate to
           true or false


          - Boolean(null);
          - Boolean("");
          - Boolean(0);



 ### What is True in JavaScript

 For comparisson purposes true is:

    if (true && "hello" && 1 && -1 && 'false') {

        console.log('all true');

    }



  true, &&, 1,

  Any number that is non-zero will evaluate to true
  string 'false' will evaluate to true since isn't a non empty string
