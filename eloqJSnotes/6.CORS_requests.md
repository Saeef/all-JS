## CORS requests

Cross-domain requests require the use of techniques like
JSONP, in order to deal with browser's same-origin policies.

## JSONP


The url request in the `<script>` element in your page
returns Json data with JavaScript code wrapped around 
it (a function call).

Why? A workaround, because without JSONP you'll get
this:
     
- raw JSON data which is inaccessible without a variable.

````
   {
        "name" : "Stefano",
        "id" : 4355,
        "city": "London"
   }

````
So the fix is (by convention) that the server providing
the JSON data offers the requesting website to name the 
JSONP function, typically using a 'callback' as the named
query parameter.

````
<script type="application/javascript"
        src="http://server.example.com/Users/4355?callback=parseResponse">
</script>
````

So now instead, you'll get this:

````
parseResponse
          (
           {         
               "name" : "Stefano",
               "id" : 4355,
               "city": "London"
           }
         )

````
and this now you can access.

## Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS)
Allows cross-domain communication from the browser by
building on top of the XMLHttpRequest Object.

Ex.    
- Site B wants to access some data from Site A     
- Same-origin policy does not allow it.     
- So Site A decides to support CORS requests and adds a
  few response headers that allows Site B to access this
  data.
  
  
## CORS Request
 
 1. First you need to create the **Request Object**
 (helper method to sort out browser differences).
 
````
    function createCORSRequest(method, url) {
      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      if ("withCredentials" in xhr) {
    
        // Check if the XMLHttpRequest object has a "withCredentials" property.
        // "withCredentials" only exists on XMLHTTPRequest2 objects.
        xhr.open(method, url, true);
    
      } else if (typeof XDomainRequest != "undefined") {
    
        // Otherwise, check if XDomainRequest.
        // XDomainRequest only exists in IE, and is IE's way of making CORS requests.
        xhr = new XDomainRequest();
        xhr.open(method, url);
    
      } else {
    
        // Otherwise, CORS is not supported by the browser.
        xhr = null;
    
      }
      return xhr;
    }
    
    var xhr = createCORSRequest('GET', url);
    if (!xhr) {
      throw new Error('CORS not supported');
    }


````

2. **Event Handlers**

- The original XMLHttpRequest object had only one event
  handler `onreadystatechange` which handle all responses.
  
  XMLHttpRequest2 introduces a bunch of new event handlers.
  
  - `onloadstart`   when the request starts
  - `onprogress`    while loading/sending data
  - `onabort`       when request aborted
  - `onerror`       when request failed
  - `onload`        when request successfully completed
  - `ontimeout`     when specified timeout passed before
                    completion
  - `onloadend`     when request has completed
  
  
  
 - For most cases you'll need `onload` and `onerror` events
 
 ````
     xhr.onload = function() {
      var responseText = xhr.responseText;
      console.log(responseText);
      // process the response.
     };
     
     xhr.onerror = function() {
       console.log('There was an error!');
     };
 
 ````
