SIX BASIC TYPES OF VALUE IN JAVASCRIPT
======================================

     STRINGS
     BOOLEANS
     OBJECTS
     FUNCTIONS
     UNDEFINED VALUES
     
     
NUMBERS => ARE NUMERIC VALUES  . EX: 13
=======

     JAVASCRIPT USES USES A FIXED NUMBER OF BITS (64 BITS) TO STORE A SINGLE NUMBER VALUE

     3 TYPES OF SPECIAL NUMBERS/ VALUES IN JAVASCRIPT:
          +    INFINITY
          +    -INFINITY
          +    NAN



STRINGS => USED TO REPRESENT TEXT
=======

     +    ALMOST ANYTHING CAN BE PUT BETWEEN STRINGS
     +    BACKSLASH TO ESCAPE (\)
     +    \n IS A NEW LINE
     +    2 BACKSLASHES IS AN ACTUAL BACKSLASH
     +    YOU CAN CONCATENATE STRINGS USING +  . THAT'S ABOUT IT.
     

UNARY OPERATORS
===============

     +    NOT ALL OPERATORS ARE SYMBOLS LIKE + OR -    (SOME ARE WRITTEN WORDS)
     +    typeof OPERATOR 
               typeof(4) => number
               type("x") => string
               typeof TAKES ONLY ONE VALUE. OPERATORS THAT USE TWO VALUES ARE CALLED BYNARY OPERATORS
